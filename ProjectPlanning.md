## Project Planning
- [ ] Create a character class that holds attributes for the character

- [ ] Work on the first adventure as a separate class



### Class implementations
- [ ] Linked List
- [ ] ArmourSet
    - ArmourSet is a linked list of pieces of armour
    - The set can be swapped out with another bundle and each new piece of armour should be worn from the new set
        - Maybe a hashmap would be better for this feature?
        - Re-assigning the head of the linkedlist to the new armourSet and wearing armour based on the name of the piece
        - With a linked list I need to make sure that there are no duplicate items in a set
    - Items from the armour should be interchangeable one at a time
        - The linked list should be able to get one item at a time
